Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Michigan State University. 

I like national parks and board games.

My research interests are econometric theory and applied econometrics, with a focus on but not limited to robust inference for panel models, high dimensional models, unobserved heterogeneity, discrete choice, and endogeneity issues. 

Please contact me at chenka19@msu.edu for anything!
