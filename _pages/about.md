## Welcome to Kaicheng's home page!

I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Michigan State University. My research interest lies in econometrics, with a focus on but not limited to ***robust inference for panel models***, ***high dimensional models***, ***unobserved heterogeneity***, ***endogeneity***, ***treatment effect models***, and ***discrete choice models***. I am on the 2024-2025 job market.

*<span style="color:grey">I also love national parks ⛺ and board games ♜.</span>*

Please feel free to reach me at `chenka19@msu.edu`.
