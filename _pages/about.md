Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Michigan State University. 

My research interests are econometric theory and applied econometrics, with a focus on but not limited to robust inference for panel models, high dimensional models, unobserved heterogeneity, discrete choice, and endogeneity issues. 

I also like national parks and board games.

Please contact me at `chenka19@msu.edu` for anything!
