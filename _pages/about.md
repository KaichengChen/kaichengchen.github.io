<br />

Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Michigan State University. 

My research interest lies in econometric theory and applied econometrics, with a focus on but not limited to ***robust inference for panel models***, ***high dimensional regression***, ***unobserved heterogeneity***, ***discrete choice***, and ***endogeneity***. 

*<span style="color:grey">I also love national parks and board games.</span>*

Please feel free to reach out to me at `chenka19@msu.edu` for anything.
