## Welcome to Kaicheng's home page!

I hold a PhD in Economics at Michigan State University. I will be joining the School of Economics at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics as an assistant professor. My research interest lies in econometrics, with a focus on but not limited to ***high-dimensional methods for panel and times series data***, ***robust inference for panel models***, ***fixed-smoothing inference***, and ***discrete choice models***.
