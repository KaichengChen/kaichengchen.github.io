Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Michigan State University. I will be on the job market in 2024-2025. my research interest are econometric theory and applied econometrics, with a focus on but not limited to robust inference in panel models with inter-cluster dependence, debiased machine learning in panel models without exchangeability, nonseparable models with endogeneity.
