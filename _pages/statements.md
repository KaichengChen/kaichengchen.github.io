## Teaching Statement
<details>
<summary>My passion for teaching began long before I entered graduate school. </summary>

More precisely, it was on a flight to Singapore during a high school field trip back in 2011. Seated next to our supervising teacher, I was killing time with my 3-by-3 Rubik's Cube, which was a trend in school. It was a long trip from Shanghai and likely our supervisor was bored so she asked me if I could teach her how to solve it and said she never succeeding learning it. I certainly wasn’t an expert—I could barely finish it in under a minute—but I started sharing what I knew. I remember it was due to a line like "Instead of letting the blocks find the edge, you should let the edge pick up the blocks" that she told me it was a eureka moment for her and that she believed I could be very a good teacher.\


Though this moment planted the seed for my teaching aspirations, my initial pursuit of an education major in college was unsuccessful. It was not until my master’s program, when I was appointed as a teaching assistant for EC15 Basic Econometrics, that my passion for teaching was rekindled. Every time I held an office hour I would be happy if I had students visiting me. One time after I explained the algebra of the ordinary least square estimator to a group of students, one student said to me, "Kaicheng, you are the best!" I was so glad and their enthusiasm truly touched me.\


Throughout my five years in the PhD program, I spent more time on research than teaching, yet I cherished those moments of accomplishment during office hours or recitations when students experienced their own breakthroughs. These moments continually reaffirmed my passion and the mission of education.\


I am very fortunate to be advised and taught by Professor Vogelsang who will also serve as my lifetime example of what a good teacher/professor/advisor/mentor is like. He is a chill person in life but is at the same time very serious about research and lectures. Most importantly, he cares about students. Despite his remarkable academic pedigree, he remains humble and deeply invested in his students’ growth. He constantly encourages students and truly believes they can achieve more. Instead of pushing for outcomes, he helps students realize their potential. I have been profoundly moved by his support to many students (including myself). Serving as his teaching assistant for three semesters has been a unique and rewarding experience. He not only involves me in lectures but also regularly discusses with me about individual students, ensuring we provide the necessary support for their success.\


I wouldn’t say I was the perfect TA. There was one time he wanted me to have a Zoom review session before the exam. It was scheduled on a Saturday, but I didn't realize it until more than half an hour passed and no students were waiting for me. I figured I could just finish the review session and upload the recording so students could watch it later, but Professor Vogelsang promptly encouraged me to hold another live session the following day, emphasizing that students deserve the opportunity to ask questions in real time. Though I felt disappointed in myself, I learned a valuable lesson about what it truly means to care for students.\


As I prepare to take on the responsibilities as a teacher/professor/advisor/mentor, I realize it won't be an easy journey but I am lucky to have such a role model and my early passion to guide me through. I have served as a teaching assistant for PhD-level micro theory and econometrics, as well as for various undergraduate courses, including microeconomics and econometrics for juniors and seniors,and introductory microeconomics for freshmen. Additionally, I taught a summer course on intermediate macroeconomics for undergraduates. Through my own research, I am also well-equipped to teach machine learning methods, data cleaning and analysis as well as matrix programming.\
