## Teaching Statement
<details>
<summary>My passion for teaching began long before I entered graduate school. Precisely, it was on a flight to Singapore as a high school group field trip back in 2011. Seated next to our supervising teacher, I was killing time with my 3-by-3 Rubik's Cube, which was a trend in school. It was a long trip from Shanghai</summary>

and likely our supervisor was bored so she asked me if I could teach her how to solve it and said she never succeeding learning it. I certainly wasn’t an expert—I could barely finish it in under a minute—but I started sharing what I knew. I remember it was due to a line like "Instead of letting the blocks find the edge, you should let the edge pick up the blocks" that she told me it was a eureka moment for her and that she believed I could be very a good teacher. 

However, my pursuit of teaching took a pause. I applied to a college with an education major but wasn't accepted. It wasn’t until my master’s program when I was hired as a teaching assistant for EC15 Basic Econometrics, that I rediscovered my passion. Every time I held an office hour I would be happy if I had students visiting me. One time after I explained the algebra of the ordinary least square estimator to a group of students, one student said to me, "Kaicheng, you are the best!" I was so glad and their enthusiasm truly touched me.

Throughout my five years in the PhD program, I spent more time on research than teaching, yet I cherished those moments of accomplishment during office hours or recitations when students experienced their own breakthroughs. These moments continually reaffirmed my passion and the mission of education.

I am very fortunate to be advised and taught by Prof. Vogelsang who would also serve as my lifetime example of what a good teacher/professor/advisor/mentor is like. He is very chill in life but is at the same time very serious about research and lectures. Most importantly, he cares about students. Despite graduating from the most prestigious schools, he remains incredibly humble. He constantly encourages students and truly believes they can achieve more. Instead of pushing for outcomes (it would have worked for some courses but at the cost of mental stress to many students), he helps students realize their potential. I have been profoundly moved by his support to many students (including myself). I have been working as his TA for three semesters straight. It is probably easiest in terms of the workload—he would never ask a TA to do something when he could have done it himself—but it is never easy in terms of involvement. I was asked to attend lectures, both for undergrads and graduate courses, and we regularly talk about the courses and students after our discussion on research in his office (he is also my committee chair). We would spend considerable time talking about individual students, discussing who was excelling and who might need additional help. By the end of one semester, I knew nearly every student’s name in a class of over 40.

I wouldn’t say I was the perfect TA. There was one time he wanted me to have a Zoom review session before the exam. It was scheduled on a Saturday, but I didn't realize it until more than half an hour passed and no students were waiting for me. I figured I could just finish the review session and upload the recording so students could watch it later. After I was done with the recording, I told him what happened. He wasn’t pleased and insisted I hold another review session the next morning, emphasizing that students deserve the opportunity to ask questions in real time. I conducted another review session the next morning. Though I felt disappointed in myself, I learned a valuable lesson about what it truly means to care for students.

Soon, I will also take responsibility as a teacher/professor/advisor/mentor. It won't be an easy journey but I am lucky to have a lifelong role model and my early passion to guide me through. For the record, I have served as a teaching assistant for PhD-level micro theory twice and econometrics once. Additionally, I have assisted with various undergraduate courses, including microeconomics and econometrics for juniors and seniors, as well as introductory micro for freshmen. I also taught a summer course on intermediate macroeconomics for undergraduates. Furthermore, I can teach data cleaning and analysis in STATA (or R) and matrix programming in Mata due to my own research.
